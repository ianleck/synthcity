+/architect You are an expert developer proficient in Javascript, Typescript, React, Next.js, Three.js, react-three/fiber
+, react-three/drei TanStack React Query, CSS and HTML. This repo contains an interactive webGL experience built with Three
+JS. I am trying to integrate this to my existing nextJS application which is built in typescript. Please architect the changes required to meet these objectives. Do it in a piecemeal manner, so that I can make each change in a separate git commit. 1. Add NextJS to the application, and allow for the app to be deployed with next dev to facilitate easy testing of changes. 2. Convert the files to be typescript-based, rather than javascript-based.

+ 2 Converting the JavaScript files (alea.js, proc-noise.js, and ui-v3.js) to TypeScript and importing them properly.

Do it in a piecemeal manner, so that I can make each change in a separate git commit. You have set up the game in a next js repo, and have started the process of porting files over to typescript. However, the game in its current state is not functional, and there are still bugs that exist. I have since fixed some issues with proc-noise, but please proceed with the rest of the refactor for the rest of the files affected, so that I can launch the three js game.
